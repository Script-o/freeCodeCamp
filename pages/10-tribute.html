            <h2>Here are some quotes left behind from Archbishop Tutu</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>"If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse, and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality."</li>
                <li>"Don't raise your voice, improve your argument."</li>
                <li>"When we see others as the enemy, we risk becoming what we hate. When we oppress others, we end up oppressing ourselves. All of our humanity is dependent upon recognizing the humanity in others."</li>
                <li>"There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river. We need to go upstream and find out why theyâ€™re falling in."</li>
                <li>"Language is very powerful. Language does not just describe reality. Language creates the reality it describes"</li>
                <li>"Dear Child of God, I am sorry to say that suffering is not optional."</li>
                <li>"Freedom and liberty lose out by default because good people are not vigilant."</li>
                <li>"I am not interested in picking up crumbs of compassion thrown from the table of someone who considers himself my master. I want the full menu of human rights"</li>
                <li>"Ubuntu is very difficult to render into a Western language... It is to say, 'My humanity is caught up, is inextricably bound up, in what is yours.'"</li>
            </ul>
